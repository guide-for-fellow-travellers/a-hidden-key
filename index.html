  <h1>A Hidden Key</h1>

  <p>Wow, another website, very impressive, I know...</p>

  <p>Jokes aside, it was a good excuse to learn a little coding this summer, in the
    spirit of keeping busy...</p>

  <p>So, onto what I know you are here for, your key... Here it is. Simple and straight forward:</p>

  <!--Centered Image Start-->

  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img width=100% src="Key.png" alt="Well, look at you, I think we both know you weren't supposed to see this... But if you managed to find this text, you may as well get a hint for your troubles. Search autostereogram">
  </div>
  <!--Centered Image End-->

  <p>Good luck! Use this key wisely, and you can make your way onto the next step of the journey.</p>

  <p>Onwards with your quest.</p>
